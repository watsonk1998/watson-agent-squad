SNAPSHOT_KEYWORDS_EXTRACTION = """
Analyze the following document and extract the most relevant and representative key phrases.
Prioritize terms that capture the core topics, central concepts, important entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations), and domain-specific terminology.
Exclude generic words (e.g., "the", "and", "result", "study") unless they are part of a meaningful multi-word phrase.
Limit the output to {max_num} concise key phrases, ranked by significance.
You **MUST** output the key phrases as a comma-separated list without any additional explanation or formatting.
You **MUST** adjust the language of the key phrases to be consistent with the language of the input document.

SNAPSHOT_TOC_EXTRACTION = """
Generate a Table of Contents (ToC) from the given document, adapting its depth and content density to the document’s inherent complexity.

Requirements:

1. Adaptive Hierarchy Depth: Dynamically set the depth between 3 to 5 levels, based on the document’s structural and semantic complexity (e.g., 3 levels for simple notices, 5 for technical specs).
2. Summarized Entries: Each ToC item must concisely summarize the section’s core content (10–25 words), not just repeat headings. Capture purpose, key actions, or critical info.
3. Faithfulness: Do not invent sections. Infer headings only from logical paragraph groupings if explicit titles are absent.
4. Format: Use Markdown nested lists with 2-space indents per level (e.g., - → - → -). Output ToC only—no preamble or commentary.

**Input Document**:

QUERY_KEYWORDS_EXTRACTION = """
### Role: Search Optimization Expert & Information Retrieval Specialist

### Task:
Extract **{num_levels} sets** of keywords from the user query with **different granularities** to maximize search hit rate.

### Multi-Level Keyword Granularity Strategy:

Extract {num_levels} levels of keywords with progressively finer granularity:

{level_descriptions}

### IDF Value Guidelines:
- Estimate the **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)** for each keyword based on its rarity in general corpus
- IDF range: **[0-10]** where:
  - 0-3: Very common terms (e.g., "the", "is", "data")
  - 4-6: Moderately common terms (e.g., "algorithm", "network")
  - 7-9: Rare/specific terms (e.g., "backpropagation", "xgboost")
  - 10: Extremely rare/specialized terms
- IDF values are **independent** of keyword level - focus on term rarity, not granularity

### Requirements:
- Each level should have 3-5 keywords
- Keywords must become progressively **finer-grained** from Level 1 to Level {num_levels}
- **Level 1**: Coarse-grained phrases/multi-word expressions
- **Level {num_levels}**: Fine-grained single words or precise technical terms
- ONLY extract from the user query context; do NOT add external information
- Ensure keywords at different levels are complementary, not redundant

### Output Format:
Output {num_levels} separate JSON-like dicts within their respective tags:

{output_format_example}

### User Query:
{{user_input}}
